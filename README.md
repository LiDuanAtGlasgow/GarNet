# GarNet
## Introduction

Robot deformable object manipulation is a major challenge in the robot manipulation discipline. Due to the unpredictable and complicated status space of deformable objects, a robot needs to learn object geometric and physical properties before manipulations. This paper proposes a garment similarity network (GarNet) that learns geometric and physical similarities between garments and predicts shapes and discretised weights (weight levels) of unseen garments through continuously observing garment-motion video sequences. Our approach features an ‘early stop’ strategy, which means the GarNet does not need to observe the whole video sequences to make a prediction but maintains high prediction accuracies. We find that our GarNet achieves prediction accuracies of 98 % for shapes and 95 % for discretised weights.

My name is Li Duan (Ken) and I am a 3rd-year PhD student @ University of Glasgow, Scotland. My interests include robot continuous perception and deformable object manipulation. Recently, I am working on investigating geometric and physical properties of fabrics and garments, from which I am keen on engineering methods to improve robot deformable object manipulations.\
